# a2d2 is an Android API for DHIS2

This API contains an object model for core DHIS2 web based tasks through its REST API, a database model and implementation and other extras to make it cool and fun.

To use it one would need to have a knowledge of ROOM database, Android Architecture components, RXJava, Dagger, Retrofit, DHIS2 and be familiar with Star Wars. While some components are not fully abstracted, we aim for a good architecture which works and can be continuously improved, and best, which can be understandable and is small. Consequently, we will concentrate on having only generic features to be within this API so it can be used across as many of our projects.
